.SYNOPSIS
Provides SCSM Exchange Connector functionality through PowerShell

.DESCRIPTION
This PowerShell script/runbook aims to address shortcomings and wants in the
out of box SCSM Exchange Connector as well as help enable new functionality around
Work Item scenarios, runbook automation, 3rd party customizations, and
enabling other organizational level processes via email

Contributors: Martin Blomgren, Leigh Kilday, Tom Hendricks, nradler2, Justin Workman, Brad Zima, bennyguk, Jan Schulz, Peter Miklian, Daniel Polivka, Alexander Axberg, Simon Zeinhofer, Konstantin Slavin-Borovskij
Reviewers: Tom Hendricks, Brian Wiest
Inspiration: The Cireson Community, Anders Asp, Stefan Roth, and (of course) Travis Wright for SMlets examples
Requires: PowerShell 4+, SMlets, and Exchange Web Services API (already installed on SCSM workflow server by virtue of stock Exchange Connector).
    3rd party option: If you're a Cireson customer and make use of their paid SCSM Portal with HTML Knowledge Base this will work as is
        if you aren't, you'll need to create your own Type Projection for Change Requests for the Add-ActionLogEntry
        function. Navigate to that function to read more. If you don't make use of their HTML KB, you'll want to keep $searchCiresonHTMLKB = $false
    Signed/Encrypted option: .NET 4.5 is required to use MimeKit.dll
Misc: The Release Record functionality does not exist in this as no out of box (or 3rd party) Type Projection exists to serve this purpose.
    You would have to create your own Type Projection in order to leverage this.

                 Fixed issue with [approved] and [rejected] if groups or users belong to a different domain.
Version: 1.4.1 = Fixed issue raised on $irLowUrgency, was using the impact value instead of urgency.
Version: 1.4 = Changed how credentials are (optionally) added to SMLets, if provided, using $scsmMGMTparams hashtable and splatting.
                Created optional processing of mail from multiple mailboxes in addition to default mailbox. Messages must
                    be REDIRECTED (not forwarded) to the default mailbox using server or client rules, if this is enabled.

                Created event handlers that trigger customizable functions in an accompanying "custom events" file. This allows proprietary
                        or custom functionality to be added at critical points throughout the script without having to merge them with this script.
                Created $voteOnBehalfOfGroups configuration variable so as to introduce the ability for users to Vote on Behalf of a Group
                Created Get-SCSMUserByEmailAddress to simplify how often users are retrieved by email address
                Changed areas that request a user object by email with the new Get-SCSMUserByEmailAddress function

Version: 1.3.1 = Fixed issue matching users when AD connector syncs users that were renamed.
                Changed how Request Offering suggestions are matched and made.
Version: 1.3 = created Set-CiresonPortalAnnouncement and Set-CoreSCSMAnnouncement to introduce announcement integration into the connector
                    by leveraging the new configurable [announcement] keyword and #low or #high tags to set priority on the announcement.
                    absence of the tag results in a normal priority announcement being created
                created Get-SCSMAuthorizedAnnouncer to verify the sender's permissions to post announcements
                created Get-CiresonPortalAnnouncements to search/update announcements
                created Read-MIMEMessage to allow parsing digitally signed or encryped emails. This feature leverages the
                    open source project known as MimeKit by Jeffrey Stedfast. It can be found here - https://github.com/jstedfast/MimeKit
                created Get-CiresonPortalUser to query for a user through the Cireson Web API to retrieve user information (object)
                created Get-CiresonPortalGroup to query for a group through the Cireson Web API to retrieve group information (object)
                created Search-AvailableCiresonPortalOfferings in order to look for relevant request offerings within a user's
                    Service Catalog scope to suggest relevant requests to the Affected User based on the content of their email
                improved/simplified Search-CiresonKnowledgeBase by use of new Get-CiresonPortalUser function
                created Get-SCOMDistributedAppHealth (SCOM integration) allows an authorized user to retrieve the health of
                    a distributed application from Operations Manager. Features configurable [keyword].
                created Get-SCOMAuthorizedRequester (SCOM integration) to verify that the individual requesting status on a SCOM Distributed Application
                    is authorized to do so
Version: 1.2 = created Send-EmailFromWorkflowAccount for future functions to leverage the SCSM workflow account defined therein
                updated Search-CiresonKnowledgeBase to use Send-EmailFromWorkflowAccount
                created $exchangeAuthenticationType so as to introduce Windows Authentication or Impersonation to bring to closer parity with stock EC connector
                expanded email processing loop to prepare for things other than IPM.Note message class (i.e. Calendar appointments, custom message classes per org.)
                created Schedule-WorkItem function to enable setting Scheduled Start/End Dates on Work Items based on the Calendar Start/End times.
                    introduced configuration variable for this feature ($processCalendarAppointment)
                updated Attach-EmailToWorkItem so the Exchange Conversation ID is written into the Description as "ExchangeConversationID:$id;"
                issue on Attach-EmailToWorkItem/Attach-FileToWorkItem where the "AttachedBy" relationship was using the wrong variable
                created Verify-WorkItem to attempt to begin identifying potentially quickly responded messages/append them to
                    current/recently created Work Items. Trying to address scenario where someone emails WF and CC's others. If the others
                    reply back before a notification about the current Work Item ID goes out (or they ignore it), they queue more messages
                    for the connector and in turn create more default work items rather than updating the "original" thread/Work Item that
                    was created in the same/previous processing loop. Also looking to use this function to potentially address 3rd party
                    ticketing systems.
                    Introduced configuration variable for this feature ($mergeReplies)
Version: 1.1 = GitHub issue raised on updating work items. Per discussion was pinpointed to the
                Get-WorkItem function wherein passed in values were including brackets in the search (i.e. [IRxxxx] instead of IRxxxx). Also
                updated the email subject matching regex, so that the Update-WorkItem took the $result.id instead of the $matches[0]. Again, this
                ensures the brackets aren't passed when performing the search/update.

<#ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OPTION 1, enable AI through Azure Cognitive Services
#PLEASE NOTE: HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL!
By enabling this feature, the entire body of the email on New Work Item creation will be sent to the Azure
subscription provided and parsed by Cognitive Services. This information is collected and stored by Microsoft.
Use of this feature will vary between work items and isn't something that can be refined/configured.
#### SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ####
The information returned to this script is a percentage estimate of the perceived sentiment of the email in a
range from 0% to 100%. With 0% being negative and 100% being positive. Using this range, you can customize at
which percentage threshold an Incident or Service Request should be created. For example anything 95% or greater
creates an Service Request, while anything less than this creates an Incident. As such, this feature is
invoked only on New Work Item creation.
#### KEYWORD ANALYSIS ####
#It also returns what Azure Cognitive Services perceives to be keywords from the message. This is used to speed up searches
#against the Cireson Knowledge Base and/or Service Catalog for recommendations back to the Affected User.
#### !!!! WARNING !!!! ####
Use of this feature and in turn Azure Cognitive services has the possibility of incurring monthly Azure charges.
Please ensure you understand pricing model as seen at the followng URL
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/text-analytics/
Using this URL, you can better plan for possible monetary charges and ensure you understand the potential financial
cost to your organization before enabling this feature.#>

#ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE OPTION 3, enable AI through Azure Machine Learning
#PLEASE NOTE: HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL!
#While using Azure Cognitive Services introduces some intelligence to the connector, Azure Machine Learning introduces
#a feedback loop that can ensure the connector applies increasing levels of intelligence based on your own unique SCSM environment.
#This is done by taking a subset of data from your SCSM DW, uploading to Azure Machine Learning, and then training ML on said dataset.
#Details on setup/configuration can be found on the SMLets Exchange Connector Wiki.
#Once trained, you can publish an AML web service the connector can consume in order to intelligently predict the
#Work Item Type (Incident/Service Request), Work Item Support Group, Work Item classification, and Impacted Configuration Items. Once enabled, you to set a minimum
#percent threshold before these values are applied. In doing so, you can ensure high standards for incoming email classification so
#AML only engages when met otherwise it will fallback to your Default Work Item template. Finally, AML can co-exist with the ACS
#feature that defines Priority/Urgency/Impact based on Sentiment Analysis.
